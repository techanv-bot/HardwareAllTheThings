# GoodFET

* [travisgoodspeed/goodfet](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodfet) - An embedded bus adapter for various microcontrollers and radios.
* [greatscottgadgets/Facedancer](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/Facedancer) - modern FaceDancer core for multiple devices-- including GreatFET


## Facedancer

The Facedancer21 is the twenty-fourth hardware revision of the GoodFET, owing its heritage to the GoodFET41 and Facedancer20. Unlike the general-purpose GoodFET boards, the only purpose of this board is to allow USB devices to be written in host-side Python, so that one workstation can fuzz-test the USB device drivers of another host.
