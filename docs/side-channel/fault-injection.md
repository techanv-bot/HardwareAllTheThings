# Fault Injection

## Power / VCC Glitch

Power glitch injection is a physical attack technique used to test and exploit vulnerabilities in electronic devices by causing controlled, temporary power disturbances.
A VCC glitch, also known as a supply voltage glitch, is a specific type of power glitch attack targeting the voltage supply (VCC) of a microcontroller or integrated circuit (IC) in electronic devices.

## Electromagnetic Fault

Electromagnetic Fault Injection is an advanced technique used in hardware security and testing, where electromagnetic pulses are used to induce faults in electronic devices

## Clock Glitch

This technique involves momentarily disrupting or altering the clock signal of a device to induce errors or malfunctions in its operation.

In the case of an external SPI flash, it is possible for an attacker to short these pins :

The MCU will not be able to get data from the external flash and then show a stacktrace, get a shell in the bootloader or worst a root shell on the embedded Linux.

Here is a practical example, putting a cable between MOSI and Chip Select :
